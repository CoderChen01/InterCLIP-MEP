# üòºInterCLIP-MEP: Interactive CLIP and Memory-Enhanced Predictor for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2406.16464-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16464)

## üìÑAbstract

The prevalence of sarcasm in social media, conveyed through text-image combinations, presents significant challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been proven to overestimate performance, as they struggle to effectively capture the intricate sarcastic cues that arise from the interaction between an image and text. To address these issues, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, a novel framework for multi-modal sarcasm detection. Specifically, we introduce an Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) as the backbone to extract text-image representations, enhancing them by embedding cross-modality information directly within each encoder, thereby improving the representations to capture text-image interactions better. Furthermore, an efficient training strategy is designed to adapt InterCLIP for our proposed Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP). MEP uses a dynamic, fixed-length dual-channel memory to store historical knowledge of valuable test samples during inference. It then leverages this memory as a non-parametric classifier to derive the final prediction, offering a more robust recognition of multi-modal sarcasm. Experiments demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the [MMSD2.0](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.689) benchmark, with an accuracy improvement of 1.08% and an F1 score improvement of 1.51% over the previous best method.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏èInstallation

### Virtual Environment

We use [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv) to manage the Python environment.

If you haven't installed `Python 3.9`, please run the following command:

```bash
pyenv install 3.9
```

> Note: pyenv will try its best to download and compile the wanted Python version, but sometimes compilation fails because of unmet system dependencies, or compilation succeeds but the new Python version exhibits weird failures at runtime. (ref: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment)

Then, create a virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.9.19 mmsd-3.9.19
```

Finally, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
pyenv activate mmsd-3.9.19
```

You can also create the virtual environment in any way you prefer.

### Dependencies

We use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the dependencies. Please install it first.

Then, install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏èDataset preprocessing

We use [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index) library to read the dataset.

Therefore, we provide a script [convert_mmsd2_to_imagefolder_data.py](./scripts/convert_mmsd2_to_imagefolder_data.py) to convert MMSD2.0 into a format readable by the Hugging Face datasets library and upload it to Hugging Face.
Please follow the instructions in [MMSD2.0](https://github.com/JoeYing1019/MMSD2.0?tab=readme-ov-file) to prepare the data.

Then, modify line 12 in [convert_mmsd2_to_imagefolder_data.py](./scripts/convert_mmsd2_to_imagefolder_data.py) to specify the dataset path. Next, change line 64 to the name of the dataset you wish to upload to Hugging Face (before doing this, you must first login using `huggingface-cli`, for details see: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/upload_dataset#upload-with-python).
Afterwards, run the script `python scripts/convert_mmsd2_to_imagefolder_data.py`.

Finally, you need to modify line 69 in the [dataset.py](./mmsd/dataset.py) file to specify the name of the dataset you uploaded.
